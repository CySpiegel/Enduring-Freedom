        description = "%2%3Avulsions%4%1Occur when an entire structure or part of it is forcibly pulled away, such as the loss of a permanent tooth or an ear lobe. Explosions, gunshots, and animal bites may cause avulsions. %1Sources: explosions, vehicle crashes, grenades, artillery shells, bullets, backblast. %1Effects: pain - extremely high, bleeding - extremely fast (depends on wound size).%1%1%2%3Contusions%4%1 Also called bruises, these are the result of a forceful trauma that injures an internal structure without breaking the skin. Blows to the chest, abdomen, or head with a blunt instrument (e.g. a football or a fist) can cause contusions. %1Sources: bullets, backblast, vehicle crashes, falling. %1Effects: pain - light, no bleeding.%1%1%2%3Cut Wounds%4%1Slicing wounds made with a sharp instrument, leaving even edges. They may be as minimal as a paper cut or as significant as a surgical incision. %1Sources: vehicle crashes, grenades, explosions, artillery shells, backblast.%1Effects: pain - light, bleeding - speed depends on length and size of the wound.%1%1%2%3Lacerations (tears)%4%1These are separating wounds that produce ragged edges. They are produced by a tremendous force against the body, either from an internal source or from an external source like a punch.%1Sources: vehicle crashes.%1Effects: pain - light, bleeding - slow to medium speed (depends on wound size).%1%1%2%3Puncture wounds%4%1Deep, narrow wounds produced by sharp objects such as nails, knives, and broken glass.%1Sources: shrapnel, grenades.%1Effects: pain - light, bleeding - slowly.%1%1In order to stop the bleeding, all bleeding injuries on every body part requires treatment. This is done by either applying a tourniquet to legs or arms as a temporary solution, or by using bandages to stop the bleeding as a more permanent fix.";
