# Enduring-Freedom
A multiplayer mission for arma 3

![](../master/AirBase.png)


This mission is an attempt to simulate overseas deployments to Afghanistan during the height of the ISIS insurgency. Civilians will react to Blufor presence and interactions with how they are treated. Each location maintains their own hostility levels, so that it is possible for the civilians to be friendly in one town that is relatively clear of insurgents while another town is hostile. Players can lower hostilities in a town by removing IEDs, treating wounded civilians, routing out insurgent enclaves from the town and by delivering humanitarian aid (medicine, water, food) supplies from IDAP. Failure to keep a strict ROE when inside towns will cause riots whereby the civilians will gather in groups yelling and throwing object at players. Insurgents will attempt to gain followers by abusing the civilian population and force them to become plane clothed insurgents that will attempt to gather intelligence, plant IEDs, and even suicide bombings.
