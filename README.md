# Enduring-Freedom
Overview  
This mission is an attempt to simulate an overseas deployments to Afghanistan during the height of the ISIS insurgency set in the arma universe. Civilians will react to Blufor presence and interactions with how they are treated. Each location maintains their own hostility levels, so that it is possible for the civilians to be friendly in one town that is relatively clear of insurgents while another town is hostile. Players can lower hostilities in a town by removing IEDs, treating wounded civilians, routing out insurgent enclaves from the town and by delivering humanitarian aid (medicine, water, food) supplies from IDAP. Failure to keep a strict ROE when inside towns will cause riots whereby the civilians will gather in groups yelling and throwing object at players. Insurgents will attempt to gain followers by abusing the civilian population and force them to become plane clothed insurgents that will attempt to gather intelligence, plant IEDs, and even suicide bombings.

Players have the ability to build FOBs, outposts, and checkpoints if they so desire depending on funds available. All objects created and funds are tracked via database to keep continuation possible after server restart. To keep the mission from devolving into pure mayham a design choice was implemented so that funds are replenished from doing humanitarian aid.

This mission supports up to a maximum of 3 headless clients on the server and requires at minimum 1 headless client.

ALiVE Database  
This mission is set up to use the ALiVE Database on alivemod.com
Please set up an account on this website and configure your servers according to the documentation. This is needed to allow for database saving of the mission to save progress.

Humanitarian Aid  
IDAP offers humanitarian aid missions upon player request. Completing these mission will lower the civilian hostility levels in the town that aid is delivered. Upon completing these mission, the faction funds will also increase allowing you to build more bunkers and FOBs using the ACE fortification system.

Vehicle Spawn System  
This mission does not have any vehicles, fixed wing aircraft or rotor aircraft on base. To get access to vehicles you must use the vehicle spawn system. They are the big UAV terminals in the briefing room near the spawn area and in the main hangar. All spawned Vehicles cost $100 from the available funds in the fortify tool so the build system and the vehicle spawn system share the same budget pool. First vehicle at mission start is free.

Detention Center  
If you capture an enemy and bring them to the detention center, overtime the hostility of the towns will be lowered. It takes 60min per enemy combatant before the debuf is applied to the game state.
