# Enduring-Freedom
A multiplayer mission for arma 3

![](../master/AirBase.png)


This mission is an attempt to simulate overseas deployments to Afghanistan during the height of the ISIS insurgency. Civilians will react to Blufor presence and interactions with how they are treated. Each location maintains their own hostility levels, so that it is possible for the civilians to be friendly in one town that is relatively clear of insurgents while another town is hostile. Players can lower hostilities in a town by removing IEDs, treating wounded civilians, routing out insurgent enclaves from the town and by delivering humanitarian aid (medicine, water, food) supplies from IDAP. Failure to keep a strict ROE when inside towns will cause riots whereby the civilians will gather in groups yelling and throwing object at players. Insurgents will attempt to gain followers by abusing the civilian population and force them to become plane clothed insurgents that will attempt to gather intelligence, plant IEDs, and even suicide bombings. 

Players have the ability to build FOBs, outposts, and checkpoints if they so desire depending on funds available. All objects created and funds are tracked via database to keep continuation possible after server restart. To keep the mission from devolving into pure mayham a design choice was implemented so that funds are replenished from doing humanitarian aid.

This mission supports up to a maximum of 3 headless clients on the server and requires at minimum 1 headless client.
